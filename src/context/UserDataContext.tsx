  about: `
    I am a final-year student specializing in Applied Artificial Intelligence at the Pristini School of AI in Tunisia. 
    My studies and hands-on projects have strengthened my knowledge in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. 
    I have practical experience preparing and training models, building interactive applications, and managing databases. 
    Through internships at Sartex Group, I gained valuable skills in data science, model development, and IT systems management. 
    I am passionate about applying AI techniques to solve real-world problems and contributing to innovative international projects.
